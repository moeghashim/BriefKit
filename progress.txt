Learnings
- Users want a minimal entry point: one brief input with a mic and optional typing, then a guided interview.
- Interview questions must be tailored to the idea and exclude budget/timeline topics.
- Interactive, one-question-at-a-time flow reduces confusion versus static forms.
- Live feature/story previews help users validate direction before export.
- Editing generated features (voice or text) is important for user control.
- Interview questions must stay focused on building requirements (no marketing/support).
- Input modes are now limited to record or type to reduce confusion.
- Users can finish the interview early to generate docs or restart the interview.
- The workspace now splits after the first answer, with loading feedback for preview updates.
- Fixed layout prevents long questions from pushing input controls off-screen.
- Unified shell structure smooths transitions between brief and interview states.
- Hiding empty history and summary sections reduces visual clutter on the first question.
- Input mode toggle now uses a pill switch with persistent mic buttons to avoid layout shifts.
- Question numbering starts on the second interview prompt to help users track progress.
- Feature notes and story notes are deferred to the final phase to reduce mid-interview clutter.

Preview
- Split the workspace into a 1/3 interview pane and a 2/3 feature view.

- Lowered the rule line and added a repo link in the brief header.
- Left panel now uses a flex-column layout with a fixed input area at the bottom.
- "Show previous answers" and "Summary" sections are hidden until populated.
- Question typography is smaller and easier to scan.
- Feature list is collapsible with summary headers and "Feature 1/2/3" labels.
- Feature table heading is larger for clearer section hierarchy.
