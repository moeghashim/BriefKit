Learnings
- Users want a minimal entry point: one brief input with a mic and optional typing, then a guided interview.
- Interview questions must be tailored to the idea and exclude budget/timeline topics.
- Interactive, one-question-at-a-time flow reduces confusion versus static forms.
- Live feature/story previews help users validate direction before export.
- Editing generated features (voice or text) is important for user control.
- Interview questions must stay focused on building requirements (no marketing/support).
- Input modes are now limited to record or type to reduce confusion.
- Users can finish the interview early to generate docs or restart the interview.
- The workspace now splits after the first answer, with loading feedback for preview updates.

Preview
- Split the workspace into a 1/3 interview pane and a 2/3 feature view.
- Added a "Finalizing table" loading indicator for preview updates.
- Lowered the rule line and added a repo link in the brief header.
